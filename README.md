Image_Computations
=================

Python librairy to create virtual material images and to compute their physical properties.
Initiated by Tristan Agaesse, CEA Liten, in 2014.


Rely on several other python librairies : numpy, scipy, scikit-image, SimpleITK, VTK, hdf5storage...

First steps:
To read tiff image files, use ImageJ software with the 3dViewer plugin.
To use python, install the anaconda distribution, then the needed external librairies with 'pip install' command
